<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Use of pesticides and other crop protection products is a topical issue in an environmental and societal context. These products are increasingly criticized for their risks and impacts on human health and environment. Crop monitoring models are developed and their efficiency is well demonstrated. Acting at the right time in plots is inscreasingly possible thanks to these models. In Belgium, the Walloon agricultural resarch centre (CRA-W) is a research centre where a lot of issues are explored to bring solutions. 

From May 22nd to August 20th, I did an internship in the (CRA-W). I worked on the AGROMET project which is a project about agrometeorology where the aim is to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters at the resolution of 1 km² for the whole region of Wallonia characterized by a quality indicator. This project is led by the Farming Systems, Territory and Information Technologies Unit.

The internship has for objective to investigate a spatial interpolation of the temperature using multiple linar regression with the best combination of explanatory variables. 

First, the report will present the CRA-W, its organisation, the Unit where I worked and the project. Then, my workflow will be detailed in two parts : the data acquisition and the data analysis through the benchmark. Finally, the results will be interprated and discussed.
