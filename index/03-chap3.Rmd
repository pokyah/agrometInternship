# Modeling with machine learning methods {#model}

Once the dataset is ready, the next step is to model spatial predictions of temperature. To do that, machine learning is used through R.

## Principle of machine learning

### Definition

Machine learning is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code specific to the problem. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it builds its own logic based on the data. In other words, Machine learning is a subset of deep learning or Artificial Intelligence that provides an ability to “learn” with data. 

&nbsp;

There are 2 types of machine learning : supervised and unsupervised learning.

In practice, most of machine learning uses supervised learning.

&nbsp;

From *machinelearningmastery.com* :

>Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output : Y = f(X).  
The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x), you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.  
It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process

&nbsp;

For supervised machine learning, the algorithm tries to learn from examples we give to it and then it returns a model of prediction. Classification and regression are supervised machine learning.  

This is the case of the AGROMET project where regression models are used.

The unsupervised machine learning is not relevant in the context of my work because this kind of machine learning does not need reference to infer patterns and cannot be directly applied to regression problems.

## Machine learning approach in the AGROMET project

The objective is to spatially predict weather parameters (temperature, relative humidity, leaves wetness). We use data from meteorological stations and from other sources like EUMETSAT for solar irradiance and COPERNICUS for land cover as explanatory variables for these weather parameters and to build our models.

&nbsp;

Here is our approach :

We choose a weather parameter to predict, it is our __target__. In the context of my internship, _temperature_ is my target variable.

Then, from the historical dataset of hourly weather records from PAMESEB database, a representative subset of records is filtered. Stations are filtered to only keep the useful ones which are active. For each hourly set of records, a benchmark experiment is run with multiple linear regression algorithm, the __learner__, applied to various regression __tasks__, i.e. the target response variable (temperature) and all the chosen __explanatory variables__ (elevation, slope, land cover...). The different combinations of explanatory variables using multiple linear regression algorithm are compared and ranked using a __cross-validation resampling strategy__. Several methods exist but we will use the Leave-One-Out cross-validation method (LOOCV). It consists to establish, for each hourly dataset, a model based on every weather stations except one which will be the one where the model is tested to compute the error and then doing it again as many times as the number of weather stations. Performance metrics (RMSE and MAE) have been stored for each of these iterations.

&nbsp;

These performance metrics are two of the most common metrics used to measure accuracy for continuous variables and for validation step in machine learning.

&nbsp;

MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

\[
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{ \lvert y_{j} - \widehat{y}_{j} \rvert}
\]

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. It is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation.

\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{( y_{j} - \widehat{y}_{j} )^2}}
\]


The entire methodology is detailed in the _Appendix A_ (Spatialization methodology).


## Machine Learning in R

All of our work is done using R. Moreover, a R package which provides the infrastructure to run machine learning is available. This package **mlr** is very complete to build models, make predictions and evaluate performances.

Machine learning in R offers a common and simplified interface for all statistical methods implemented in the package. With this package, run a benchmark with several statistical methods can be done on data from a period. This benchmark returns a lot of informations :

- about learners and task descriptions used in the benchmark
- about models, test performance values, predictions from the benchmark

The package includes several ways to analyze benchmark results. Plots are integrated to visualize results and learning algorithms can be compared and ranked. It is possible to compare learners and tasks through measures of error like RMSE or MAE. In the case ofmy internship, the learner is always the same, multiple linear regression, and tasks change because I modify the set of explanatory variables used.

```{r mlr, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mlr workflow", out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}

```

The Figure \@ref(fig:mlr) shows the general workflow of `mlr`.

&nbsp;

This package has an important community which improves it regularly. A lot of statistical methods are implemented from other packages like _tgp_, _kknn_ or _DiceKriging_.
